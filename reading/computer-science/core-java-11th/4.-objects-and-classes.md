# 4. Objects and Classes

## 4.1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

An object-oriented program is made of objects. Each object has a specific functionality, exposed to  its users, and a hidden implementation.

Traditional structured programming consists of designing a set of procedures (or algorithms) to solve a problem. Once the procedures are determined, the traditional next step was to find appropriate ways to store the data.

### 4.1.1 Classes

A class is template or blueprint from which objects are made.

Encapsulation(sometimes called information hiding) is a key concept in working with objects. Formally, encapsulation is simply combining data and behavior in one package and hiding the implementations details from the users of the object.

The key to make encapsulation work is to have methods never directly access instance fields in a class other than their own. Programs should interact with object data only through the object's methods.

### 4.1.3 Identifying Classes

### 4.1.4 Relationships between classes

The most common relationships between classes are

* Dependence (uses a)
* Aggregation (has a)
* Inheritance (is a)

## 4.2 Using Predefined Classes

### 4.2.1 Objects and Object Variables

It is important to realize that an object variable doesn't actually contain an object. It only refers to an object.
