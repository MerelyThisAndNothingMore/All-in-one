# App Navigation

## Principles of navigation

Navigation between different screens and apps is a core part of the user experience. The following principles set a baseline for a consistent and intuitive user experience across apps.

### Fixed start destination

### Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations

When your app is first launched, a new task is created for the user, and app displays its start destination. The top of the stack is the current screen, and the previous destinations in the stack represent the history of where you've been. The back stack always has the start destination of the app at the bottom of the stack.
