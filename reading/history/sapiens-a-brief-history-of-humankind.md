# Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

## The Cognitive Revolution

### An animal of No Significance

It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last 100,000 years - with the rise of Homo Sapiens - that man jumped to the top fo the food chain.

### The Tree of Knowledge

Although Sapiens had already populated East Africa 150,000 years ago, they began to overrun the rest of planet Earth and drive the other human species to extinction only about 70,000 years age.
