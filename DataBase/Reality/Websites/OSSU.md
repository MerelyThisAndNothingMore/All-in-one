# Introduction 
The [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum is a complete education in [[computer science]] using online materials. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate [[computer science]] majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements.
## Organization 
The curriculum is designed as follows:
-   _Intro CS_: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
-   _Core CS_: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
-   _Advanced CS_: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
-   _Final Project_: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide
