In [[面向对象编程|OOP]], a [[Method|Method]] is a procedure or [[Function|Function]]  that is defined as part of a [[class|class]] and is available to any [[Object|Object]] instantiated from that [[class|class]]. Each [[Object|Object]]  can call the method, which runs within the context of the object that calls it.
A method is a [[Function|Function]] that is associated with a [[class|class]] and operates on the data members of the class, while a function is a standalone piece of code that can be called from anywhere in the program.
