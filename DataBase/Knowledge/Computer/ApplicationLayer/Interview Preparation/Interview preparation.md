# 流程
总体来说，面试一般都是基于你的简历来进行的，
一般先考察你的基础，
然后考察你知识体系的完备程度，
接着会考察你的极限，
最后还会考察一些软技能，比如你的学习能力、协作能力、沟通能力、分析解决未知问题的能力、抗压能力等。

## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along with the lines of the items below. Have at least one answer for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing product
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?
## Have questions for the interviewer

Some of mine (I already may know the answers, but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?
- How is the work/life balance?
