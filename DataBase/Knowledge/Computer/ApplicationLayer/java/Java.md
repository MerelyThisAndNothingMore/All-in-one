## Classes and Objects 
Three events occur as particular of the creation of a new instance of a class:
- A new [[Object]] is dynamically allocated  in memory, and all instance variables are initialized to standard default values. The default values are null form reference variables and 0 for all [[Base types in Java]] except boolean variables (which are false by default )
- The constructor for the new [[Object]] is called with the parameters specified.
- After the constructor returns, the new operator returns a reference (that is, a memory address) to the newly created [[Object]].
