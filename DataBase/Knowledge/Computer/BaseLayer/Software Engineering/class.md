## Declaring Instance Variables 
When defining a class, we can declare any number of instance variables. An important principle of object-orientation is that each instance of a class maintains its own individual set of instance variables (that is, in fact, why they are called instance variables).
## Declaring methods 
A method definition has two parts: the signature, which defines the name and parameters for a method, and the body, which defines what the method does. The method signature specifies how the method is called, and the method body specifies what the object will do when it is called.
