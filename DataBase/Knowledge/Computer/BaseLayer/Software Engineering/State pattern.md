# Introduction 
The [[State pattern]] is a [[Behavioral pattern]] that allows an [[Object]] to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of [[Finite-state machine]]. The [[State pattern]] can be interpreted as a [[Strategy pattern]], which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
