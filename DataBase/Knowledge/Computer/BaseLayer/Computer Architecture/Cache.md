A system spends a lot of time moving information from one place to another. A major goal for system designers is to make these copy operations run as fast as possible.
Similarly, a typical register file stores only a few hundred bytes of information, as opposed to billions of bytes in the main memory. However, the processor can read data from the register file almost 100 times faster than from memory.
To deal with the processor-memory gap, system designers include smaller, faster storage devices called cache memories (or simply caches) that serve as temporary staging areas for information that the processor is likely to need in the near future.
