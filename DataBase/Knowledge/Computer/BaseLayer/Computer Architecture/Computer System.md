# Introduction
A computer system consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run application programs. Specific implementations of systems change over time, but the underlying concepts do not. All computer systems have similar hardware and software components that perform similar function.
系统不仅仅只是硬件。系统是硬件和系统软件互相交织的集合体，它们必须共同协作以达到运行应用程序的最终目的。
