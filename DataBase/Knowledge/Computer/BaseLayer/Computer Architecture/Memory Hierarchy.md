This notion of inserting a smaller, faster storage device (e.g., cache memory) between the processor and a larger, slower device (e.g., main memory) turns out to be a general idea. In fact, the storage devices in every computer system are organized as a memory hierarchy.
The main idea of a memory hierarchy is that storage at one level serves as a cache for storage at the next lower level.
