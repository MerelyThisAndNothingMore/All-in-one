# Introduction
In order to run programs on computer system, the individual high-level statements must be translated into a sequence of low-level machine-language instructions.

The compiler driver reads the source file and translates it into an executable object. The translation is performed in the sequence of four phases shown in figure above. The programs that perform the four phases(preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker) are known collectively as the compilation system.
