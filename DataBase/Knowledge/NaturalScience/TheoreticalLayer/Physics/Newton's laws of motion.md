# Introduction

1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.
2. When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its momentum equals the force.
3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.
