In practice, modern systems are often linked to other systems by networks. When the system copies a sequence of bytes from main memory to the network adapter, the data flow across the network to another machine, instead of, say, to a local disk drive. Similarly, the system can read data sent from other machines and copy these data to its main memory. 
With the advent of global networks such as the Internet, copying information from one machine to another has become one of the most important uses of computer systems.
