In [[面向对象编程|OOP]], a [[方法|方法]] is a procedure or [[方法|方法]]  that is defined as part of a [[class|class]] and is available to any [[对象|对象]] instantiated from that [[class|class]]. Each [[对象|对象]]  can call the method, which runs within the context of the object that calls it.
A method is a [[方法|方法]] that is associated with a [[class|class]] and operates on the data members of the class, while a function is a standalone piece of code that can be called from anywhere in the program.
