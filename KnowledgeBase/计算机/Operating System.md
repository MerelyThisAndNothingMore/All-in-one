Programs relied on the services provided by the operating system to access the keyboard, display, disk, or main [[Memory Hierarchy]]. We can think of the operating system as a layer of software interposed between the application program and the hardware. All attempts by an application program to manipulate the hardware must go through the operating system.
The operating system has two primary purposes:
(1) to protect the hardware from misuse by runaway applications 
(2) to provide applications with simple and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices. The operating system achieves both goals via the fundamental abstractions: [[进程|process]], [[Virtual Memory]], and [[Files]].
