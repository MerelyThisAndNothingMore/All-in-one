# Introduction
Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits
called buses that carry bytes of information back and forth between
the components. Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size
chunks of bytes known as words. The number of bytes in a word (the
word size) is a fundamental system parameter that varies across
systems.
