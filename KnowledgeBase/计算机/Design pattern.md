# Introduction 
[In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Switchboard "HTTP Switchboard") [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), a **software design pattern** is a general, [reusable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability "Reusability") solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design "Software design"). It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") or [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code"). Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized [best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice "Best practice") that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

[Object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented "Object-oriented") design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science) "Class (computer science)") or [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)"), without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming") languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming") intermediate between the levels of a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm") and a concrete [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm").
## 分类
总共有23中设计模式，可以分为三大类：

# Classification and List  
Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on what kind of problem they solve. 
- [[Creational patterns]] provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way. 
- [[Structural patterns]] are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 
- [[Behavioral patterns]] are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
