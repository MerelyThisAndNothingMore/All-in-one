*人事苦多变
万般来何急
往来温存地
长恨余叹息*

这是我在那之后最先写下的话。电脑显示这份文档（《沧桑笔记》）的变更日期是2004年5月20号晚上11点11分，但这是因为我关闭文档时反射性地按下了保存键。在五月份我其实并没有做更改，事实上，自从写下上述文字（大概在那件事发生后的几天里），这个文档我就没再动过。

很长一段时间里，我写不出任何东西。

*生活面目全非*
*在一如平常的瞬间*

当回忆起这场事故最震动我的地方时，我曾考虑使用这几个字，“一如平常的瞬间”。很快我就意识到没必要加上“一如平常”这个词，因为它盘旋在我脑海里，不会被忽视或遗忘。
在事故发生之前，一切都一如既往，这让我无法相信它真的发生了，更不用说去接受它，适应它，让它过去。
我现在认识到这才是事物的常态：当面对突发的灾难时，我们的注意力往往集中在无比寻常的环境细节上，飞机失事时想着晴朗的天空，汽车着火时想着还没做完的日常杂务，被响尾蛇从藤蔓中袭击时想着儿童经常玩耍的秋千。
“他走在下班回家的路上，快乐、振奋、健康，之后，猝然离世。”，这是我在一个精神病科护士的档案里看到的，她的丈夫死于交通事故。
1966年，我曾访问过许多于1941年12月7日清晨生活在火奴鲁鲁的人，毫无例外，当他们开始回忆珍珠港事件时，都会跟我说那个周日的清晨是多么平常啊。
“那不过是九月里寻常的一天。”，当被问起911那天早上的情形时，人们也是这么回答。
甚至连911事件调查委员会的报告，也以这种带有预兆性，读来叫人震撼的句子为开头：“2001年9月11日，星期二，美国东部气候温和，天抹微云。”

“And then—gone.” In the midst of life we are in death, Episcopalians say at the graveside. Later I realized that I must have repeated the details of what happened to everyone who came to the house in those first weeks, all those friends and relatives who brought food and made drinks and laid out plates on the dining room table for however many people were around at lunch or dinner time, all those who picked up the plates and froze the leftovers and ran the dishwasher and filled our (I could not yet think my) otherwise empty house even after I had gone into the bedroom (our bedroom, the one in which there still lay on a sofa a faded terrycloth XL robe bought in the 1970s at Richard Carroll in Beverly Hills) and shut the door. Those moments when I was abruptly overtaken by exhaustion are what I remember most clearly about the first days and weeks. I have no memory of telling anyone the details, but I must have done so, because everyone seemed to know them. At one point I considered the possibility that they had picked up the details of the story from one another, but immediately rejected it: the story they had was in each instance too accurate to have been passed from hand to hand. It had come from me.
当圣公会教徒念到“之后，猝然离世。”时，我不禁想到，活着就是与死亡相伴，持续地活着，不停地面对死亡。
之后我发现，我一定对最初的几个星期里来家里看望我的人们重复讲述了这场事故的细节。那些朋友和亲戚之中，不管是带来食物和饮料，在午餐或晚餐时在餐厅桌子上为大家摆好餐盘的，还是那些收拾餐桌，放好剩菜，打开洗碗机并且

Another reason I knew that the story had come from me was that no version I heard included the details I could not yet face, for example the blood on the living room floor that stayed there until José came in the next morning and cleaned it up.

José. Who was part of our household. Who was supposed to be flying to Las Vegas later that day, December 31, but never went. José was crying that morning as he cleaned up the blood. When I first told him what had happened he had not understood. Clearly I was not the ideal teller of this story, something about my version had been at once too offhand and too elliptical, something in my tone had failed to convey the central fact in the situation (I would encounter the same failure later when I had to tell Quintana), but by the time José saw the blood he understood.

I had picked up the abandoned syringes and ECG electrodes before he came in that morning but I could not face the blood.

         

In outline.

It is now, as I begin to write this, the afternoon of October 4, 2004.

Nine months and five days ago, at approximately nine o’clock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child, Quintana, had been for the previous five nights unconscious in an intensive care unit at Beth Israel Medical Center’s Singer Division, at that time a hospital on East End Avenue (it closed in August 2004) more commonly known as “Beth Israel North” or “the old Doctors’ Hospital,” where what had seemed a case of December flu sufficiently severe to take her to an emergency room on Christmas morning had exploded into pneumonia and septic shock. This is my attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself. I have been a writer my entire life. As a writer, even as a child, long before what I wrote began to be published, I developed a sense that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences and paragraphs, a technique for withholding whatever it was I thought or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish. The way I write is who I am, or have become, yet this is a case in which I wish I had instead of words and their rhythms a cutting room, equipped with an Avid, a digital editing system on which I could touch a key and collapse the sequence of time, show you simultaneously all the frames of memory that come to me now, let you pick the takes, the marginally different expressions, the variant readings of the same lines. This is a case in which I need more than words to find the meaning. This is a case in which I need whatever it is I think or believe to be penetrable, if only for myself.
